### 1.
Why is the art different?

We usually get the Pictures from what is saying for their api.
Most this is the starting point: static8.cdn.ubi.com\

But Ubi didnt upload every arts and much more things to their API.\
So the other arts is from ubistatic3-a.akamaihd.net.\

If there is no art then we use this
https://ubistatic-a.akamaihd.net/0123/PROD/_next/static/images/bg-footer-8015e7323ec5cdb43a544b3981b133b0.png
